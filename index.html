		<h2>Begginner's Guide</h2>
		<h5>Welcome to the world, the art, the experience of fish keeping.</h5>
		<p>Each year, thousands of new fish keepers discover the natural wonder of aquariums.
		Fish keeping provides them, and now you, have the unique opportunity to not only observe another world, but to create it as well. In the process, you’ll learn about aquatic creatures and observe their behavior firsthand. And there is nothing quite like an aquarium to generate an appreciation and respect for our environment.
		Fun, easy and instructive, an aquarium is a singularly beautiful, always fascinating addition to any home or office … a welcome source of entertainment, education and relaxation for the entire family.
				
In addition to your aquarium, filter and lighting, here’s a list of what you need
 to get started:<br>
Gravel: Coated or pre washed is ideal.<br>
Water Conditioner: De chlorinates tap water to make it fish-safe.<br>Net: For transferring fish.<br>
Gravel Washer: For water changes and cleaning.<br>
Fish Food: Consult your dealer for a recommendation.</p>

			<h2>Before You Add Fish…</h2>
			<p>When creating a new aquarium environment, patience is vital to success.
				 Allow your system to operate for at least 24 hours before adding fish.
				Begin by talking with your dealer about what fish are best suited to your aquarium, what fish are compatible with one another and how many would be appropriate.
