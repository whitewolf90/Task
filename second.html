        <h2>Betta fish</h2>

        <p>
        One of my personal favorites, it's hard not to love those little grumpy faces! 
        The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), commonly known as the betta,
        is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia, namely Cambodia, Malaysia, 
        Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is one of 73 species of the genus Betta, but the only one eponymously called "betta", owing to its global popularity as a pet; Betta splendens are among the most popular aquarium fish in the world, due to their diverse and colorful morphology and relatively low maintenance

        <h2>Goldfish</h2>
        <img src="gold1.jpg" alt="" class="center">
        <p>The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in
            the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. 
            It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most 
            popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released into the wild have become an 
            invasive pest in parts of North America.
            Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively
             small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp).
            It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000 years ago,
            and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size,
            body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, 
            red, brown, and black are known).</p>
